# About Theo

My personal website built entirely with React.js is compiled to a set of static files and hosted for free here on GitHub.

## Getting Started

- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm start` - node server starts running on http://localhost:3000

That's it.

## Deployment

Completely automatic through GitHub Actions! Just push to `master` and watch it go.
My domain name "theo-tan.com" is registered by Google Domains. I'm able to host it here through creating an A record which points to GitHub Pages' IP addresses.

## Design

I am no front-end magician. This website illustrates that.
